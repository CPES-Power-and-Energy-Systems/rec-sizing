	"""
	Use this function to compute a standalone collective MILP for a given renewable energy community (REC) or citizens
	energy community (CEC) under a pool market structure.
	This function is specific for a pre-delivery timeframe, providing the schedules for controllable assets,
	such as battery energy storage systems (BESS, presently the only modelled controllable assets) for days- to
	years-ahead, optimal transactions between REC members and optimal investments in new storage and/or RES capacities.
	The function requires the provision of several forecasts, parameters and other data which thoroughly described
	below, under the parameter "backpack". Arrays with time-varying data such as consumption/generation forecasts and
	opportunity costs must comply with the expected length defined by the MILP's horizon and step
	(e.g., for a 24h horizon, and a step of 15 minutes or 0.25 hours, the length of the arrays must be 96).
	:param backpack: {
		'nr_days' a float with the number of days to consider in the optimization
		'l_grid': an array with the applicable tariffs for self-consumed energy, in €/kWh
		'delta_t': a float or int with the optimization time step to be considered, in hours
		'storage_ratio': a float or int indicating a reference ratio between maximum admissible input and output storage
		power and storage nominal capacity, in kW/kWh; this fundamental ratio will be considered for any storage asset
		installation suggestion by the MILP
		'strict_pos_coeffs': boolean indicating if the (dynamic) allocation coefficients that are generated by the
			internal REC transactions need to be strictly positive (as the Portuguese legislation currently demands)
			or not
		'total_share_coeffs': boolean indicating that meters with surplus must share all that surplus with meters that
			are consuming in the REC if the REC has a deficit (i.e., total consumption > total generation); on the
			other hand, if the REC has a surplus (i.e., total generation > total consumption), meters with surplus must
			share their surplus with consumming members up to their consumption, and the remaning surplus can be sold
			to the retailer; this implementation follows out interpretation of the curent Portuguese law.
		'meters' : structure with information relative to each meter
		{
			#meter_id: {
				'l_buy': an array with the opportunity costs for buying energy from the retailer
				'l_sell': an array with the opportunity costs for selling energy to the retailer
				'l_cont': a float representing the the contracted power tariff of the meter, adjusted to one day
				'l_gic': a float representing the investment cost for additional RES installation in the meter,
				adjusted to one day
				'l_bic': a float representing the investment cost for additional storage installation in the meter,
				adjusted to one day
				'e_c': an array with the forecasted energy consumption behind the meter, in kWh
				'p_meter_max': a float with the maximum capacity the meter can safely handle
				'p_gn_init': a float with te initial installed RES generation capacity at the meter, in kW
				'e_g_factor': an array with the RES generation profile factor for the meter's location
				'p_gn_min': a float representing the minimum RES capacity to be installed at the meter
				'p_gn_max': a float representing the maximum RES capacity to be installed at the meter
				'e_bn_init': a float with te initial installed storage capacity at the meter, in kW
				'e_bn_min': a float representing the minimum storage to be installed at the meter
				'e_bn_max': a float representing the maximum storage to be installed at the meter
				'soc_min': a percentage, applicable to "e_bn", identifying a minimum limit to the energy content
				'eff_bc': a fixed value, between 0 and 1, that expresses the charging efficiency of the BESS
				'eff_bd': a fixed value, between 0 and 1, that expresses the discharging efficiency of the BESS
				'soc_max': a percentage, applicable to "e_bn", identifying a maximum limit to the energy content
